Status
======

This module is already quite usable though still at the early phase of development
and is considered experimental.

Synopsis
========

```nginx
    location /t {
        default_type text/html;
        echo abc;
        replace_filter 'ab|abc' X;
    }

    location / {
        # proxy_pass/fastcgi_pass/...

        # caseless global substitution:
        replace_filter '\d+' 'blah blah' 'ig';
        replace_filter_types text/plain text/css;
    }

    location /a {
        # proxy_pass/fastcgi_pass/root/...

        # remove line-leading spaces and line-trailing spaces,
        # as well as blank lines:
        replace_filter '^\s+|\s+$' '' g;
    }

    location /b {
        # proxy_pass/fastcgi_pass/root/...

        # only remove line-leading spaces and line-trailing spaces:
        replace_filter '^[ \f\t]+|[ \f\t]+$' '' g;
    }

    location ~ '\.cpp$' {
        # proxy_pass/fastcgi_pass/root/...

        replace_filter_types text/plain;

        # skip C/C++ string literals:
        replace_filter "'(?:\\\\[^\n]|[^'\n])*'" $& g;
        replace_filter '"(?:\\\\[^\n]|[^"\n])*"' $& g;

        # remove all those ugly C/C++ comments:
        replace_filter '/\*.*?\*/|//[^\n]*' '' g;
    }
```

Description
===========

This Nginx output filter module tries to do regular expression substitutions in
a non-buffered manner wherever possible.

This module does *not* use traditional backtracking regular expression engines like PCRE, rather,
it uses the new [sregex](https://github.com/agentzh/sregex) library implemented by the author himself, which was designed with streaming processing in mind from the very beginning:

A good common subset of Perl 5 regular expressions is supported by `sregex`. For the complete
feature list, check out sregex's documentation:

https://github.com/agentzh/sregex#syntax-supported

Response body data is only buffered when absolutely necessary, like facing an incomplete capture that belongs to a possible match near the data chunk boundaries.

Directives
==========

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

replace_filter
--------------
**syntax:** *replace_filter &lt;regex&gt; &lt;replace&gt;*

**syntax:** *replace_filter &lt;regex&gt; &lt;replace&gt; &lt;options&gt;*

**default:** *no*

**context:** *http, server, location, location if*

**phase:** *output body filter*

Specifies the regex pattern and text to be replaced, with optional regex flags.

By default, the filter stops matching after the first match is found. This behavior can be changed by specifying the `g` regex option.

The following regex options are supported:

* `g`

    for global search and substitution (default off)
* `i`

    for case-insensitive matching (default off)

Multiple options can be combined in a single string argument, for example:

```nginx
    replace_filter hello hiya ig;
```

Nginx variables can be interpolated into the text to be replaced, for example:

```nginx
    replace_filter \w+ "[$foo,$bar]";
```

If you want to use the literal dollar sign character (`$`), use the `$$` sequence for that,
for instance:

```nginx
    replace_filter \w "$$";
```

Use of submatch capturing variables like `$&`, `$1`, `$2`, and etc are also supported, for example,

```nginx
    replace_filter [bc]|d [$&-$1-$2] g;
```

The semantics of the submatch capturing variables is exactly the same as in the Perl 5 language.

Multiple `replace_filter` directives in the same scope is also supported.
All the patterns will be applied at the same time as in a tokenizer.
We will *not* use the longest token match semantics, but rather, patterns will be prioritized according to their order in
the configure file.

Here is an example for removing all the C/C++ comments from a C/C++ source code file:

```nginx
    replace_filter "'(?:\\\\[^\n]|[^'\n])*'" $& g;
    replace_filter '"(?:\\\\[^\n]|[^"\n])*"' $& g;
    replace_filter '/\*.*?\*/|//[^\n]*' '' g;
```

When the `Content-Encoding` response header is not empty (like `gzip`), the response
body will always remain intact. So usually you want to disable the gzip compression
in your backend servers' responses by adding the following line to your `nginx.conf`
if you are the ngx_proxy module:

```nginx
    proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding '';
```

Your responses can still be gzip compressed on the Nginx server level though.

replace_filter_types
--------------------

**syntax:** *replace_filter_types &lt;mime-type&gt; ...*

**default:** *replace_filter_types text/html*

**context:** *http, server, location, location if*

**phase:** *output body filter*

Specify one or more MIME types (in the `Content-Type` response header) to be processed.

By default, only `text/html` typed responses are processed.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

replace_filter_max_buffered_size
---------------------------------
**syntax:** *replace_filter_max_buffered_size &lt;size&gt;*

**default:** *replace_filter_max_buffered_size 8k*

**context:** *http, server, location, location if*

**phase:** *output body filter*

Limits the total size of the data buffered by the module at runtime. Default to `8k`.

When the limit is reached, `replace_filter` will immediately stop processing and
leave all the remaining response body data intact.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

replace_filter_last_modified
----------------------------

**syntax:** *replace_filter_last_modifiled keep | clear*

**default:** *replace_filter_last_modified clear*

**context:** *http, server, location, location if*

**phase:** *output body filter*

Controls how to deal with the existing Last-Modified response header.

By default, this module will clear the `Last-Modified` response header if there is any. You can specify

```nginx
    replace_filter_last_modified keep;
```

to always keep the original `Last-Modified` response header.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

replace_filter_skip
-------------------

**syntax:** *replace_filter_skip $var*

**default:** *no*

**context:** *http, server, location, location if*

**phase:** *output header filter*

This directive controls whether to skip all the `replace_filter` rules on a per-request basis.

Both constant values or strings containing NGINX variables are supported.

When the value is evaluated to an empty value ("") or the value "0" in the request output header phase, no `replace_filter` rules will be skipped for the current request. Otherwise all the `replace_filter` rules will be skipped for the current request.

Below is a trivial example for this:

```nginx
set $skip '';
location /t {
    content_by_lua '
        ngx.var.skip = 1
        ngx.say("abcabd")
    ';
    replace_filter_skip $skip;
    replace_filter abcabd X;
}
```

Installation
============

You need to install the sregex library first:

https://github.com/agentzh/sregex

And then rebuild your Nginx like this:

```bash
    ./configure --add-module=/path/to/replace-filter-nginx-module
```

If sregex is not installed to the default prefix (i.e., `/usr/local`), then
you should specify the locations of your sregex installation via
the `SREGEX_INC` and `SREGEX_LIB` environments before running the
`./configure` script, as in

```bash
    export SREGEX_INC=/opt/sregex/include
    export SREGEX_LIB=/opt/sregex/lib
```

assuming that your sregex is installed to the prefix `/opt/sregex`.

Starting from NGINX 1.9.11, you can also compile this module as a dynamic module, by using the `--add-dynamic-module=PATH` option instead of `--add-module=PATH` on the
`./configure` command line above. And then you can explicitly load the module in your `nginx.conf` via the [load_module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#load_module)
directive, for example,

```nginx
load_module /path/to/modules/ngx_http_replace_filter_module.so;
```

Trouble Shooting
================

* If you are seeing the error "error while loading shared libraries: libsregex.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
while starting nginx, then it means that the installation path of your libsregex library
is not in your system's default library search path. You can solve this issue by passing the option `--with-ld-opt='-Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib'` to nginx's `./configure` command. Alternatively, you can just add the path of your libsregex.so.0 to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment value before starting your nginx server.

TODO
====

* optimize the special case for verbatim substitutions, i.e., `replace_filter <regex> $&;`.
* implement the `replace_filter_skip $var` directive to control whether to enable the filter on the fly.
* reduce the amount of data that has to be buffered for when an partial match is already found.
* recycle the memory blocks used to buffer the pending capture data and "complex values" for replacement.
* allow use of inlined Lua code as the `replacement` argument of the `replace_filter` directive to generate the text to be replaced on-the-fly.
